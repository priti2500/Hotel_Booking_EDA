# EDA-HOTEL-BOOKING-ANALYSIS

## **Project Summary -**
   I undertook this project with the objective of understanding the business performance of a Hotel Group. The dataset includes information from two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The data spans over three years — 2015, 2016, and 2017 — and contains details such as revenue, booking records, number of stay days, booking cancellations, and total number of guests including children. It also captures information like guest waiting time, repeat visitors, food preferences, and more. Additionally, the dataset provides insights into the countries from which bookings were made, as well as the agents and distribution channels that contributed to bookings for both hotel types.
   
The data is categorized by hotel type, allowing for a meaningful comparison between City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
Before visualizing any data, I performed data cleaning — including filling in missing values and removing duplicates. This was followed by data wrangling to prepare the dataset for analysis.
I carried out separate analyses for City Hotel and Resort Hotel, as well as comparative analysis between the two. Various charts and visualizations were used to gain clearer insights into the data.

**As per the data parking spaces were not required by most of the guests.Hence they can look at other facilities to be given to guests instead of parking spaces.The hotel and resort both have cancellations, In order to decrease the rate of cancellation they have to find innovative ways.**
